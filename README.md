# Interactive portfolio website
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my projects and skills. It features a sleek dark theme with smooth animations and an easy-to-use sidebar navigation. The site includes sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact, making it simple to explore my work. Youâ€™ll find links to some of my projects, including an art display, a web resume builder, and a brain tumor detection model.
